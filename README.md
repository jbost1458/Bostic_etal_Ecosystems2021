# Bostic_etal_Ecosystems2021
Data and Scripts for Bostic et al. 2021 Ecosystems Manuscript

Data files:

WQ.csv - water quality (d18O, D17O, NO3) data corresponding to all surface water samples
[WQ.csv](https://github.com/jbost1458/Bostic_etal_Ecosystems2021/files/6461173/WQ.csv)


Column names and descriptions:

Site = Name of watershed, abbreviated. See Table 1 in Bostic et al. 2021 for full names
Date = Date of sample collection
d18O = delta 18O of NO3 (per mille)
D17O = Delta 17O of NO3 (per mille)
NO3_Total = Total No3 concentrations (mg N/L)

Q.csv - mean daily discharge for sampling period (water year 2016-2017)
[Q.csv](https://github.com/jbost1458/Bostic_etal_Ecosystems2021/files/6461174/Q.csv)


Column names and descriptions:

Site = Name of watershed, abbreviated. See Table 1 in Bostic et al. 2021 for full names
Date = Date of sample collection
Q = Daily mean discharge on sampled date (cubic meters per second)


To add: .R data files for D17O, NO3-Atm concentration, NO3-Atm yields, and PE uncertainty? (Not sure if these are neeeded if I'm providing scripts


Script files:
To add: .R scripts to calculate all the above uncertainties. Make sure scripts can be run completely using data files provided...
